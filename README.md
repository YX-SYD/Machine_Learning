1. *Finding Donors for CharityML*:  
In this project, several supervised algorithms were employed to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm from preliminary results was optimized to best model the data. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 

2. *Using Keras to build CNN as image classifer:*  
In this project, I use Keras to build a CNN classifer, which is used for image classification.
